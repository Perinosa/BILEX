# BILEX
The BILEX assesses monolingual and bilingual children's receptive vocabulary. BILEX works by presenting six distinct images to the child, followed by an audio recording a proficient female
native speaker of the respective language naming one of the image. . The childâ€™s task is to accurately identify and select the corresponding image associated with the spoken word.
This approach offers a significant advantage as it eliminates the requirement for the examiner to possess fluency in all languages being assessed by BILEX.
